###### System
1. User Location Tracking & Geo-Fencing
- Track User Location: Implement continuous location tracking (with user consent) using methods like GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, or cell tower triangulation.
- Define Geo-Boundaries: Divide the service area into distinct geographical regions (e.g., cities, counties).
- Trigger Updates: When the user's location crosses into a new region, trigger an update on the server.

2. App Server
- select appropriate db server

3. Data Synchronization (If Necessary)

- Data Replication: If needed, implement data replication or synchronization between geo-specific databases to ensure data consistency across regions (e.g., popular posts, trending topics).
- Centralized Metadata: Maintain a central database or service to store metadata about each geo-specific database (e.g., schema, data volume).


###### User moves to a New Region
1. Identify the Issue:
The core problem is that the user's information is still associated with their previous region ("Region A") even though they have moved to a different country (and potentially a new region within that country).

2. Solutions:

User Profile Migration:

- Trigger Migration: When the server detects the user's movement into a new country, trigger a process to migrate the user's profile information to the appropriate country-level database.
- Data Transfer:
    - Transfer essential user data (e.g., preferences, posts, connections) from the original region's database ("Region A_DB") to the new country's database ("CountryB_DB").
    - Consider using asynchronous processes (e.g., background jobs, message queues) to minimize the impact on real-time user experience.
- Data Cleanup (Optional): After successful migration, consider archiving or deleting the user's data from the original region's database to optimize storage and improve query performance.

Centralized User Profiles:

- Maintain a Central Database: Create a central user database that stores core user information (e.g., account details, global preferences).
- Region-Specific Data: Store region-specific data (e.g., local connections, region-specific preferences) in the respective region's database.
- Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency between the central user database and region-specific databases.

Hybrid Approach:

- Combine elements of user profile migration and a centralized user database.
- Migrate essential user data to the new country's database while maintaining a central record of core user information.
