###### System
1. User Location Tracking & Geo-Fencing
- Track User Location: Implement continuous location tracking (with user consent) using methods like GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, or cell tower triangulation.
- Define Geo-Boundaries: Divide the service area into distinct geographical regions (e.g., cities, counties).
- Trigger Updates: When the user's location crosses into a new region, trigger an update on the server.

2. App Server
- select appropriate db server

3. Data Synchronization (If Necessary)

- Data Replication: If needed, implement data replication or synchronization between geo-specific databases to ensure data consistency across regions (e.g., popular posts, trending topics).
- Centralized Metadata: Maintain a central database or service to store metadata about each geo-specific database (e.g., schema, data volume).
