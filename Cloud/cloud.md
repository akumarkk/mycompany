Region - A region is a geographical area
Availability Zone - within each region, there are multiple AZs. For example, the US East (N. Virginia) region has six AZs.
- Redundancy: Multiple AZs within a Region provide redundancy and fault tolerance for your applications and services. If one AZ experiences an outage, your applications can continue to operate in other AZs within the same region.
- High Availability: AZs can also be used for high availability purposes. If one AZ experiences an outage, your applications can continue to operate in other AZs within the same region. 
- Disaster Recovery: AZs can also be used for disaster recovery purposes. If a major event impacts an entire region, you can fail over your applications to another region.
