###### Infra Engineer
An infrastructure engineer designs, implements, and maintains an organization's digital infrastructure, including networks, servers, data centers, and cloud services:

###### Design
Create scalable, reliable, and secure network infrastructures that meet the organization's needs 
###### Implement
Install servers, develop cloud-based infrastructure, and work with storage and hosting technologies 
###### Maintain
Monitor computer systems, troubleshoot infrastructure problems, and conduct routine maintenance 
###### Support
Work with third parties to provide infrastructure services, and train or support company employees

a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) focuses primarily on ensuring the reliability and uptime of systems by monitoring performance, preventing outages, and responding to incidents, while an Infrastructure Engineer is responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the underlying IT infrastructure itself, including networks, servers, and storage, with a broader focus on overall system functionality.

Primary Focus:
SREs prioritize system stability and responsiveness through proactive monitoring and incident response, whereas infrastructure engineers focus on the technical implementation and maintenance of the infrastructure components. 
Skillset:
SREs tend to have a stronger background in software engineering, data analysis, and automation to build monitoring tools and response workflows, while infrastructure engineers may have more expertise in network engineering, system administration, and hardware configuration. 
Responsibilities:
SRE: Defining Service Level Objectives (SLOs), setting up alerts, analyzing system metrics, conducting capacity planning, automating remediation tasks, incident post-mortems. 
Infrastructure Engineer: Designing network architecture, provisioning servers, managing storage, implementing security policies, deploying updates to infrastructure components.
