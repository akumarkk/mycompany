###### Fanout service

A fanout service is a system that efficiently distributes data or messages from a single source to multiple destinations. This is often referred to as a publish-subscribe or pub-sub pattern. It's a fundamental building block in many modern applications, enabling real-time communication, data synchronization, and scalable event-driven architectures.
