## Perf testing


- non-functional s/w testing to ensure s/w works under exp. workload.
- the focus of perf test is to ensure
	- 


The focus of perf test is checking s/w program's 
	- Speed
	- reliability
	- scalability


Perf testing :
- load testing
	- under user anti. load
- stress testing
	- under extreme work loads, app break point.
- endurance testing
	- exp. load over long per. of time.
- spike testing
	- s/w reaction to large spike in load
- volume testing
 	- - large vol. of data is generated in db, app perf under varying db volumes.

perf problems:
  - long load times
  - poor response times
  - poor scalability
  - bottlenecking
  - perf bottlenecks
  	- cpu utilization
  	- mem utilization
  	- n/w utilization
  	- os initiation
  	- disk usage
