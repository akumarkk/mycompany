###### Caches
L3 cache, or Level 3 cache, is a type of cache memory that sits between the L2 cache and the main system memory (RAM). It's a larger and slower cache compared to L1 and L2, but it's still much faster than RAM.

Key Characteristics of L3 Cache:

Shared Cache: Unlike L1 and L2 caches, which are typically private to individual CPU cores, L3 cache is shared among all cores of a processor.   
Larger Capacity: L3 cache is significantly larger than L1 and L2 caches, often ranging from a few megabytes to tens of megabytes.   
Slower Access Time: While still faster than RAM, L3 cache has a longer access time compared to L1 and L2 caches.   
Why is L3 Cache Important?

Improved Performance: By storing frequently accessed data, L3 cache reduces the number of times the CPU needs to access the slower main memory.   
Enhanced Data Sharing: As a shared cache, L3 cache enables efficient data sharing between multiple CPU cores.   
Reduced Cache Misses: A larger L3 cache can help reduce cache misses, which occur when the requested data is not found in the cache.
