##### Memory

High Bandwidth Memory 4 (HBM4) is a type of memory that's designed to be faster and more efficient than traditional DRAM technologies. It's part of the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) family and is used in high-performance computing environments like data centers, AI, machine learning, and graphics applications. 

HBM4 is being developed by JEDEC, and Rambus has announced the HBM4 Controller IP, which supports data rates up to 10 Gb/s per data pin.

###### Key RAM Metrics

Capacity:
- Total RAM: The overall amount of RAM installed in the system (e.g., 8GB, 16GB, 32GB).   
- Used RAM: The amount of RAM currently being utilized by the operating system and running applications.   
- Free RAM: The amount of RAM that is not currently in use.   
- Cached RAM: The amount of RAM used to temporarily store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.   

Performance:
- Data Transfer Rate: The speed at which data can be read from and written to RAM (often measured in MT/s - Megatransfers per second).   
- Latency: The delay between a request to access data in RAM and the start of the data transfer.
- Bandwidth: The maximum amount of data that can be transferred per unit of time (e.g., GB/s).   

Utilization:
- Memory Utilization: The percentage of total RAM that is currently being used.
- High utilization can indicate insufficient RAM and potential performance issues.   
- Very low utilization might suggest underutilization of system resources.
