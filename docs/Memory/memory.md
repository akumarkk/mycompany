##### Memory

High Bandwidth Memory 4 (HBM4) is a type of memory that's designed to be faster and more efficient than traditional DRAM technologies. It's part of the High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) family and is used in high-performance computing environments like data centers, AI, machine learning, and graphics applications. 

HBM4 is being developed by JEDEC, and Rambus has announced the HBM4 Controller IP, which supports data rates up to 10 Gb/s per data pin.
