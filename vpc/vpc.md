###### VPC
- private cloud in public cloud network
- dedicated isolated resources within the public cloud
    - subnets
    - ip addresses
    - VLANS - isolated network traffic
    - VPN - sealed envelope

why VPC instead of private cloud?
- Scalability
- performance
- Flexibility - data can't go outside the VPC
